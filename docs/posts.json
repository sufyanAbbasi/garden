With this new park came a fantastic community garden with over 30 plots, outfitted with irrigation, tools, a composting bin, and even a beehive.\n\nI applied back in early 2020 and got waitlisted, but for the next garden season term in 2021, I got it! Thus begins our journey."

But I finally had an opportunity to prove myself at the Garden Cleanup Day, where I spent some time destroying the weeds around the garden.\n\nI took the opportunity to run down to [Yamagami Garden Center](https://www.yamagamis.com) and picked up a nice haul! Lots of types of peppers and tomatoes, including:\n- 2 ghost chili peppers (redundancy is key)\n- 4 types of tomatoes\n- Some herbs like basil, rosemary, and thyme to attract the nice bugs and keep the bad ones away\n- And a few succulents for aesthetics\n\nI kept some of the existing flowers which were in there; attracting more pollinators can't hurt.\n\nI'm proud to finally *finally* get started!"

These look so cool!\n\nSadly, one of the succulents I originally planted didn't make it, so I removed it. Most likely because it was overwatered due to run off. RIP, little guy."
